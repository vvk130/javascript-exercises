.NET

-CLR (Common Language Runtime)
-Class library

**C# benefits**
-C# is cross-platform

**Real numbers**

You have to add the type after using a real number
Default type for real numbers is double

float number = 1.2f;
decimal number = 1.2m; 

**Overflowing**

-C# doesn't automatically check for overflowing

byte number = 255;
number = number + 1;//0

-You have to check to prevent overflow, this will throw an error 

checked 
{
    byte number = 255;
    number = number + 1;
}

- Other way: to use other type than byte

**Scope**
